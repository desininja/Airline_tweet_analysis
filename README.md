Sentiment analysis of tweets about US Airline

I wanted to use an easy way to deploy code online, so learned about streamlit.
Here i built a dashboard for Sentiment analysis of tweets about US Ariline.
Streamlit can be implemented in python. It is very easy to understand, and build new apps, Machine learning models and data science projects.

As this is my first ever streamlit/python code, i am keeping it simple and deploying it online.

### Steps to run streamlit:
1) pip install streamlit.     #make sure you download streamlit module
2) streamlit hello.           #This is 'hello world' app, you can use this or your own python script file(.py file)
   As my file(.py file) name is application.py i will use this.
3) go to terminal/command prompt:
   - There write the directory where file is saved. (for ex-  cd /user/desktop) And execute it.
   - After this write streamlit run hello. or in my case streamlit run application.py
     It will automatically open up the web page in your browser if, it doesn't copy and paste the given link in terminal in your browser.

Voila you can see your code running.
